But if these secret golden keys did seem to open in him his own secret golden treasuries, yet did his breath upon them prove but tarnishing. Alice opened the door and found that it led into a small passage, not much larger than a rat-hole: she knelt down and looked along the passage into the loveliest garden you ever saw. How she longed to get out of that dark hall, and wander about among those beds of bright flowers and those cool fountains, but she could not even get her head through the doorway; &ldquo;and even if my head would go through,&rdquo; thought poor Alice, &ldquo;it would be of very little use without my shoulders. After a time she heard a little pattering of feet. In the distance, and she hastily dried her eyes to see what was coming. It was the White Rabbit returning, splendidly dressed, with a pair of white kid-gloves in one hand and a large fan in the other: he came trotting along in a great hurry, muttering to himself, as he came, &ldquo;Oh! The Duchess, the Duchess! Oh! Won&rsquo;t she be savage if I&rsquo;ve kept her waiting!&rdquo;</p>
